# ExpressYourNotes

## Description

Creating a note taker dynamically. As I open the Note Taker application, there will be a landing page with a link to a notes page. As I click on the link to the notes page, there will be a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty field to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column. As I enter a new note title and the note's text it should appear a Save icon in the navegation at the top of the page. As I click on the Save icon, it should show the new saved note in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. As I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, it should appear that note in the right-hand column. As I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, it should show empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.
